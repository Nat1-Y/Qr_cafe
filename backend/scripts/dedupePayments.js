/**
 * Find and clean duplicate payments for the same order.
 *
 * A duplicate is a *second* non-deleted (pending/paid) payment that covers the
 * same charge as one already on the order. Two classes are detected:
 *
 *   1. Full-order duplicates  — more than one whole-order payment on an order
 *                               (meta.scope is not 'department'). Only one
 *                               whole-order payment should ever exist.
 *   2. Department duplicates   — more than one department-scoped payment for the
 *                               SAME department on an order (meta.scope =
 *                               'department'). One per department is legitimate;
 *                               a repeat of the same department is not.
 *
 * Legitimate multi-payment orders (one department-scoped payment per distinct
 * department) are left untouched.
 *
 * For each duplicate group the *earliest* row (by paid_at, then created_at,
 * then id) is kept; the rest are HARD-DELETED from the payments table. This is
 * destructive and not reversible — run the dry preview first.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — only *same-amount* repeats are deleted. A second payment whose
 * amount differs from the keeper is treated as a possible legitimate partial /
 * installment payment: it is reported for manual review but never auto-deleted.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   PROD_DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db" node scripts/dedupePayments.js          # preview only (default)
 *   PROD_DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db" APPLY=1 node scripts/dedupePayments.js   # apply changes
 *
 * Optional: BRANCH_ID=<uuid> restricts the run to a single branch.
 *
 * Safety:
 *   - Requires an explicit PROD_DATABASE_URL so you can never hit the wrong DB.
 *   - Defaults to a dry run; you must pass APPLY=1 to delete.
 *   - The delete is a single atomic set-based statement.
