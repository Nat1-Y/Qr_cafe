/**
 * Real-time push channel for order events. Cashier/kitchen clients open a
 * socket on the `/orders` namespace and are placed into a room scoped to their
 * branch. When a waiter creates an order, OrderService calls notifyNewOrder()
 * which fans the event out only to that branch's room — so a cashier is
 * notified instantly and never sees another tenant's traffic.
 *
 * Clients authenticate the same way the REST API pins a device: a device token
 * (handshake.auth.deviceToken or the x-device-token header) is resolved to a
 * branch. Owner/admin clients without a device token may pass an explicit
 * branchId in handshake.auth.
